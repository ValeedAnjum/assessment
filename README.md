# React Flow LiveBlock + Undo/Redo Example


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

npm run build
npm run start


# The task is almost completed. Currently, undo and redo functionality works for edge connections only.
# Tomorrow, I will try to complete undo/redo functionality to support node position changes as well.
